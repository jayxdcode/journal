Bad time to start a journal, isn't it? It's actually April 5 now but i chose to start with April 3 as the entry coz why not? And actually, something's goin on and idk if its just me. I dont plan to mention any names here coz this isnt encrypted yet. But as for the reason why i still made this thing is i would like to make something that would remind me of my life in the past so that i can remember memories of my past and also just make these entries automatically set to public once i, you know, pass away.

Ok... April 3, 2025 (Thursday)

Nothing so special happen that day (past tense. as i said, im writing this at April 5 LoL). After the summative test (cant remember when, but its like before March ends), there has been nothing but us on the room coz there no classes. Also, due to the heat (why do i sound so formal asf), we go to school at 6 30, go home at 11 00. It started earlier in March.

Yeah, nothing so special but just one thing seems to be out of the ordinary. (fck i dont wanna mention a name)

Lets just say there a canon event. I think *she*'s been experiencing smth i experienced at G8. (mofo wtf?!). not morse 3 dots tho. it's Mariñas' cr- (fck you know what i mean).

(Ninja, i cant do this anymore. I hope i fed you with enough info to remember things. its fcking embarrassing to type the next things, ngl. Once im really sure about whats goin on, maybe i'll fully write it down here.)

(Ig thats it for Apr 3, до свидания с*** б****)
